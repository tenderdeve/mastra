Added stable IDs to Harness task items and new built-in tools for updating or completing one task by ID.

Tasks can now be updated or completed without replacing the full task list. This helps agents keep long-running plans stable while changing one item at a time. Task tool results now include a structured task list snapshot so agent UIs can replay task state reliably from history.

`TaskItem` now represents normalized task state and tool results with a required stable `id`. Use `TaskItemInput` for `task_write` input where the `id` may be omitted. The harness also exports `assignTaskIds` for UIs that need to replay legacy task history with the same ID assignment rules as the built-in tools.

Before this change, updating one task required rewriting the full task list with `task_write`.

```typescript
await tools['task_write'].execute({
  tasks: [
    {
      content: 'Write tests',
      status: 'in_progress',
      activeForm: 'Writing tests',
    },
    {
      content: 'Run checks',
      status: 'pending',
      activeForm: 'Running checks',
    },
  ],
});
```

Now agents can update or complete the target task by stable ID.

```typescript
await tools['task_update'].execute({
  id: 'write-tests',
  status: 'in_progress',
});

await tools['task_complete'].execute({
  id: 'write-tests',
});
```
